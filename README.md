**Project Title :** Emulation and calibration of Cardiac Digital Twins using machine learning

**Description :** Digital twins (DTs) are mathematical or computer models tailored to specific instances of real world systems or processes. DTs are increasingly used in healthcare, engineering, manufacturing and industry to provide personalised recommendations, prognosis and future predictions. Due to the complexity of modelling real world systems at high resolution, DTs often comprise high dimensional or multi-scale mathematical modelling, making them computationally expensive and slow to run, meaning it can be hard to utilise them in fast-paced real world settings, such as clinical environments.

In this project we will focus on the development of tools to aid the emulation and calibration of cardiac DTs. Cardiac DTs have the capacity to be a key tool for personalised medicine, which will allow us to make data driven clinical recommendations in real time. However, sufficiently detailed cardiac models are often computationally expensive to run and this limits their use in fast-paced clinical settings.

This project will leverage machine learning techniques to emulate a cohort of cardiac patients. Then use these emulators as a surrogate to allow us to perform model calibration to learn unknown parameters using a Bayesian statistical approach. The cohort of calibrated models may then be used for patient forecasting and in-silico trials.
